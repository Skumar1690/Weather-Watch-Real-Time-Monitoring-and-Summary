# Weather Monitoring

This project is an API proxy server that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** and implements features like **rate limiting**, **caching**, and **CORS** to enhance performance and security. The server is intended to fetch weather information for any city provided in the query.

## Features

- **CORS enabled**: Allows cross-origin resource sharing.
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests an IP can make within a set time frame (5 requests per 5 minutes).
- **Caching**: Caches weather data for 5 minutes to reduce external API requests.
- **Error Handling**: Handles and returns proper error responses for invalid requests, rate limit exceedance, and internal server errors.
- **Proxy Security**: Uses a secret API key to secure proxy requests.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get an API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
